#  SAC v0.7 - README
############################################################

Thanks for downloading SAC v0.7.

This binary distribution of SAC contains the SAC compiler sac2c
and the SAC runtime library libsac.a ready to be used for the specific 
system you selected. Moreover, the distribution comes with the
complete sources of the SAC standard library and a set of SAC demo
programs.

In order to complete your SAC installation, please run the installation
script install_sac. This will guide you through the entire installation
process and prompt you interactively where necessary. If anything goes
wrong, you may run install_sac repeatedly. If you encounter any problems
during installation, you may find useful information on the SAC web pages
at http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~sacbase. If this still does not
solve your problems, you may drop an e-mail at sacbase@informatik.uni-kiel.de.

Once your installation has been completed successfully, you may find out
how the SAC compiler sac2c works by typing sac2c -h. To find out more about
programming in SAC, have a look into the demo programs and maybe also into
those parts of the standard library that are implemented in SAC.

Enjoy yourself with SAC.
