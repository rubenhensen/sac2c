 *  sac2c public configuration file generated from sac2crc.in by configure & make.
 *
 *  This file allows to customize sac2c for specific target systems.
 *  Here are the definitions of the targets which can be specified
 *  using the -target option when calling sac2c.
 *
 *  There are two special targets:
 *  - the target named "default_sbi" is used automatically when -target
 *    is not passed on the command line.
 *  - the target named "default" is inherited by all other targets, including
 *    "default_sbi".
 *
 *  The value of an entry is always a string. Quotation marks are only
 *  required if a value contains whitespaces or special characters.
 *  Once a single entry string becomes lengthy, it may easily be cut
 *  into several substrings and written in consecutive lines.
 *
 *  Targets other than default implicitly inherit all settings from the
 *  default target. Selected entries may then be updated for the specific
 *  needs of a particular target system. Strings may also be extended rather
 *  than updated by writing "+=" instead of ":=".
 *
 *  Each target may inherit settings from other targets. This is simply
 *  specified by "::<name>" follwing directly behind the name of the new
 *  target. Multiple inheritence is possible and will be resolved in the
 *  same sequence as the inherited targets appear.
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * caution:
 *
 *  sac2c will not check for recursively inheriting targets. This may cause
 *  non-terminating compiler runs.

 *                  The directory name is substituted via %path%.
 *                  This may be set to -L%path" or a more complex string
 *                  for systems with dynamic libraries and run-time paths.
