 *  sac2c public configuration file generated from sac2crc.in by configure.
 *
 *  This file allows to customize sac2c for specific target systems.
 *  Here are the definitions of the targets which can be specified 
 *  using the -target option when calling sac2c.
 *  
 *  The special default target presets each configuration entry. The value 
 *  of an entry is always a string. Embracing the string with quotation
 *  marks is only required if it contains whitespaces or special characters.
 *  Once a single entry string becomes lengthy, it may easily be cut into
 *  several substrings and written in consecutive lines.
 *  
 *  Targets other than default implicitly inherit all settings from the
 *  default target. Selected entries may then be updated for the specific
 *  needs of a particular target system. Strings may also be extended rather
 *  than updated by writing "+=" instead of ":=".
 *  
 *  Each target may inherit settings from other targets. This is simply
 *  specified by "::<name>" follwing directly behind the name of the new
 *  target. Multiple inheritence is possible and will be resolved in the
 *  same sequence as the inherited targets appear.
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * caution:
 *
 *  sac2c will not check for recursively inheriting targets. This may cause
 *  non-terminating compiler runs.

 *
 *  CC              CC specifies the C compiler which is called by sac2c in 
 *                  order to generate machine code.
 *                  
 *  CCFLAGS         CCFLAGS specifies the flags CC is always called with.
 *                  
 *  CCINCDIR        CCINCDIR specifies the directories where CC has to look for
 *                  non-standard header files.
 *                  
 *  CCLIBDIR        CCLIBDIR specifies the directories where CC has to look for
 *                  object code files, and libraries.
 *
 *
 *  LDFLAGS         LDFLAGS specifies the linker flags to be used when creating
 *                  executables. These have to be specified in the way the 
 *                  C compiler (specified in CC) expects them to be, e.g., in
 *                  case of gcc :   "-Wl,-multiple_defines,supress"
 *                  instead of      "-multiple_defines supress"        .
 * 
 *  LD_DYNAMIC      Linker call required to build a dynamic library. The 
 *                  compiler replaces all occurences of %libname% with the
 *                  filename of the library. If LD_DYNAMIC is empty, no 
 *                  dynamic library will be built.
 *
 *  LD_PATH         Defines how to set the search path of the linker. All
 *                  occurrences of %path% will be replaced by the path to add.
 *                  The string is repeated for each path.
 *                  
 *  CCLINK          CCLINK specifies the libraries an executable always has to
 *                  be linked with.

 *                  has to be linked with, additionally. 
 *
 *  CCDLLINK        CCDLLINK specifies the libraries an executable that makes use
 *                  of runtime specialization has to be linked with, additionally. 
 *
 *  TREE_CC         Specifies the C compiler call required to build a component
 *                  of the syntax tree representation used in modules. This 
 *                  needs to be the same as used when compiling the compiler 
 *                  itself.
 *
 *  TREE_LD         Specifies the linker call required to assemble the syntax
 *                  tree part of a compiled module. This needs to be the same
 *                  as used when compiling the compiler itself.
 *
 *  LD_PATH         Defines how to set the search path of the linker when
 *                  linking the tree representation of a module. All 
 *                  occurrences of %path% will be replaced by the path to add.
 *                  The string is repeated for each path; it needs to be the 
 *                  same as used when compiling the compiler itself.
 *
 *  BACKEND         Defines which backend to use for a target. 
 *
 *  RC_METHOD       Defines which reference counting implementation to use.
 *                  For the list of the reference counting methods
 *                  see the file doc/ref-counting-methods.txt
 *
 *  LIB_VARIANT     Gives a tag that will be added to the name of each
 *                  library that result of the compilation of a SAC module
 *                  file. Useful to keep multiple versions of the standard
 *                  library for different targets.
 *
 *  MT_LIB          Multithreading backend library: either pthread or lpel.
 *                  This is effective only when compiling with -mt enabled.
 *
 *  DISTMEM_COMMLIB Communication library for distributed memory backend
 *                  This is effective only when compiling for the DistMem backend
 *
 *  COMMLIB_CONDUIT Conduit of communication library to be used
 *                  This is effective only when compiling for the DistMem backend
 *                  and if the communication library offers multiple conduits.

 *                  
 *  OPT_g           OPT_g specifies the C compiler option to add debug information
 *                  into the generated machine code for later usage by a debugger.
