SaC Archive
===========

What?
-----

This archive contains the SaC compiler and runtime libraries.

Install?
--------

Run the `install.sh' script, ensure that you specify:
  -s for the source location of the SaC compiler and library files, e.g. the
     location you unpacked the tarball.
  -i for the install location of where to place the files

Additionaly Details
-------------------

The standard library of SaC-Lang can be found at github.com/sacbase. After compiling
the library, you are going to have to create a config file in your home directory
called `.sac2crc'. In this file you'll need to add the search path of the stdlib's
.so files in order for the compiler to use them. An example of what this file contains
is given:

```
target add_stdlib_local:
TREE_OUTPUTDIR += ":STDLIB-BUILD_DIR/lib"
LIB_OUTPUTDIR  += ":STDLIB-BUILD_DIR/lib"

target default_sbi :: add_default_sbi :: add_local :: add_stdlib_local:
```
