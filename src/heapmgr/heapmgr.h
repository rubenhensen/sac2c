/*****************************************************************************
 *
 *   The SAC Private Heap Manager.
 *
 *****************************************************************************
 *
 *   SAC uses a private heap management facility for performance reasons.
 *   The main reason for this is the lousy runtime performance of the Solaris
 *   implementations of malloc() and free() when it comes to multi-threaded
 *   program execution. Furthermore, the private heap manager allows for a
 *   richer interface that exploits static knowledge of the source code for
 *   optimizing memory allocation and de-allocation tasks.
 *
 *
 * arenas:
 *
 *   The heap is organized in so-called arenas. An arena is an organizational
 *   entity for requested heap chunks of a certain size range. Each arena is
 *   associated with a minimum and maximum chunk size, a bin size, an allocation
 *   and de-allocation function, and a free list. A characteristic of this free
 *   list is that it is never empty; it always has a first dummy entry with size 0.
 *   This allows for a more efficient implementation of the free list handling.
 *
 *   There are 4 different variations of arenas:
 *    - small chunk arenas,
 *    - large chunk arenas,
 *    - top arena,
 *    - arena of arenas.
 *
 *   In a small chunk arena, each chunk of memory has the same size which is
 *   characteristic for the arena. This allows fast allocation/de-allocation
 *   strategies. However, it is only feasible for rather small memory requests
 *   because it implies significant internal memory fragmentation.
 *
 *   In large chunk arenas, each allocated chunk of memory is associated with
 *   its size, i.e. different chunk sizes within the range of the given
 *   arena may occur.
 *
 *   The top arena basically is a large chunk arena. It satisfies the
 *   class of largest memory requests. The top arena, however, is the only
 *   arena which may arbitrarily be extended by requesting more memory from the
 *   operating system.
 *
 *   Large and small chunk arenas are organized as subsequently allocated bins of
 *   contiguous memory. These bins are allocated in the so-called arena of arenas.
 *   The bins of the arena of arenas itself are allocated within the top arena.
 *   Note that bins are never de-allocated. The reason is that it is too costly
 *   to identify completely empty bins.
 *
 *
 * bins:
 *
 *   Except for the top arena, arenas are organized in bins of contiguous
 *   memory. The first time, a memory request for a certain arena occurs,
 *   a bin is allocated within the arena of arenas. Each time a new request
 *   cannot be satisfied within the already allocated bins of the arena,
 *   a new bin is allocated.
 *
 *
 * initialization:
 *
 *   When the heap manager is initialized upon program startup, a certain
 *   configurable amount of memory is requested from the operating system
 *   and the following memory layout is established:
 *
 *     |                  |
 *     +------------------+
 *     |                  |
 *     |  arena of arenas |
 *     |                  |
 *     +------------------+
 *     |                  |
 *     |  top arena       |
 *     |                  |
 *     +------------------+
 *     |                  |
 *
 *   The default sizes are 1MB each for the first bin of the arena of arenas
 *   and the top arena.
 *
 *
 * administration data layout:
 *
 *   Memory is always allocated in so-called units (currently sizeof(double)).
 *   This assures proper alignment as required by malloc().
 *
 *   Each separately indentifiable chunk of memory (allocated or de-allocated)
 *   is associated with some administrative information:
 *
 *   Small chunks:
 *
 *     |                  |
 *     +==================+
 *     | size/diag        |
 *     +------------------+
 *     | arena_ptr        |
 *     +==================+
 *     | nextfree_ptr     |     <-- returned pointer
 *     +------------------+
 *     |                  |
 *     +==================+
 *     |                  |
 *
 *   The size field conatains the size of the memory chunk in units. This
 *   information does exclusively exist for those chunks that are not of the
 *   fixed chunk size of the small chunk arena. For example, each time a new
 *   bin is allocated it is kept as a whole. Subsequently small chunks of the
 *   fixed chunk size are split from this. These small fixed size chunks are
 *   never coalasced again and don't have size information themselves.
 *   The variable sized initial chunk in a small chunk arena is called a
 *   wilderness chunk.
 *
 *   The arena_ptr is a pointer back to the arena data structure which contains
 *   all the characteristic information about the arena. This pointer allows
 *   a quick determination of the free list and the de-allocation function
 *   upon a de-allocation request for a specific memory chunk (free).
 *
 *   The nextfree_ptr points to the next entry of the free list. This is only
 *   available when the chunk is currently un-allocated. Otherwise the memory
 *   cell belongs to the memory returned by the allocator. This technique helps
 *   to minimize the administrative overhead in terms of memory consumption.
 *
 *   Split chunks (of the fixed chunk size) use the size field for storage of a
 *   diagnostic pattern iff diagnostic heap management is activated. This pattern
 *   allows to detect certain forms of corruptions of the internal heap manager
 *   data structures caused by programs that write over the allocated amount of
 *   memory.
 *
 *   Large chunks:
 *
 *     |                  |
 *     +==================+
 *     | prevsize         |
 *     +------------------+
 *     | diag             |
 *     +==================+
 *     | size             |
 *     +------------------+
 *     | arena_ptr        |
 *     +==================+
 *     | nextfree_ptr     |     <-- returned pointer
 *     +------------------+
 *     |                  |
 *     +==================+
 *     |                  |
 *
 *   In contrast to the field entries of a small chunk administration block, a large
 *   chunk administration block always contains the diagnostic pattern as well as
 *   the chunk size in units.
 *
 *   Additionally the size of the preceding chunk (in units) is stored. A negative
 *   number in this field means that the preceding chunk is currently allocated.
 *   This information is needed for efficient coalascing of neighboring un-allocated
 *   memory chunks.
