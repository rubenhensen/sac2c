/*
 * The module "constants" implements an abstract datatype for keeping "machine"
 * constants (scalars as well as arbitrary shaped arrays). This file describes
 * the interface to that module.
 *
 * For avoiding un-intended pointer sharing and for avoiding memory leaks
 * we establish the following rules:
 * - whenever a constant is given as argument, it will be inspected only!
 *   Neither the pointer to it nor any pointer to a sub structure will be
 *   returned or used within a data structure that serves as a result!
 *   There are EXACTLY ONE CLASSE OF FUNCTIONS that is an EXEPTION OF
 *   THIS RULE: - the GETxyz - functions for extracting components of constants
 * - The only function for freeing a shape structure is COFreeConstant!
 * - If the result is a shape structure, it has been freshly allocated!
