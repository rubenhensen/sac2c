/*
 * The module "shape" implements an abstract datatype for keeping
 * shapes of arbitrary length. This file describes the interface to that
 * module.
 * For avoiding un-intended pointer sharing and for avoiding memory leaks
 * we establish the following rules:
 * - whenever a shape is given as argument, it will be inspected only!
 *   Neither the pointer to it nor any pointer to a sub structure will be
 *   returned or used within a data structure that serves as a result!
 * - The only function for freeing a shape structure is SHFreeShape!
 * - If the result is a shape structure, it has been freshly allocated!
