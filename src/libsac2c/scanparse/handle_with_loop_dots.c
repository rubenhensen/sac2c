/**
 * @file handle_with_loop_dots.c
 *
 * This file elides dots from With-Loop generators and it 
 * standardises all generator relations to (lb <= iv < ub ...)
 *
 * Dots at boundary positions within genarray/ modarray - withloops
 * are replaced by the minimal/maximal possible value, eg. 0s and
 * the shape vector-1. We also 'normalize' the relations to <= for
 * lower boundaries and < for the upper ones.
 *
 * The semantics has been refined as of Nov 2018! Now, the dots no
 * longer are necessarily of maximum length. Instead, the length
 * adjusts to the length of the scalar index-vector (if present)
 * or the length of the non-dot bound (if present). 
 * In case both are absent, the old behaviour is maintained.
 *
 * The reason for this extension is that it makes the resolution
 * of LHS-dots in set expressions much easier and, at the same time,
 * it enables the use an unconstrained(!) use of single dots in the
 * relations of set-expressions. An example for this is:
 *
 * Assume m to be of type int[10,10]. An expression
 *
 *   { [.,i] -> m[i] | [5] <= [i] < . }
 *
 * with the old semantics of the dot in the constraints would have meant
 *
 *   { [.,i] -> m[i] | [5] <= [i] < [9,9] }
 * 
 * which is illegal. With the new, more flexible semantics of the dot in
 * relations we obtain:
 *
 *   { [.,i] -> m[i] | [5] <= [i] < [9] }
 *
 * which equates to:
 *
 *  with {
 *   ([0,5] <= [x,i] < [10,9]) : m[i][x];
 *  } : genarray( [10,9], 0 );
 *
