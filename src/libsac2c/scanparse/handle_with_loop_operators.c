/**
 * This traversal transformes Single-Generator Multi-Operator With-Loops into
 * sequences of Single-Generator With-Loops that contain at most one operator
 * of the three standard operators {genarray, modarray, and fold}.
 * NB: The reason why we want to do this is that we do not want to add full
 * support for Multi-Operator With-Loops with arbitrary ranges in the back-end.
 * (At the time being 10.10.2006, we require Multi-Operator With-Loops in the
 * back-end to have identical overall ranges....)
 *
 * As of 21.11.2018, we still do not support Multi-Operator With-Loops with
 * arbitrary ranges in the back-end. However, as WLFS is not effective enough
 * we want to avoid splitting multi-operator WLs that have only generators with
 * identical range or propagate operators.
 * We implement a check in the local function IsLegitimateMoWl (node *withop, info*)
 * which is being used in HWLOwith to prevent splitting.
 *
 * As of 21.8.2021, we try to extend the capabilities for keeping Multi-Operator
 * With-Loops even further. This time, we want to support With-Loops that contain
 * several modarray operators provided they modify the same array and we want to
 * support multiple fold-operators. These should be straight forward as single generator 
 * fold with-loops solely iterate over the generator guaranteeing identical ranges.
 * We extend IsLegitimateMoWl accordingly.
 *
 *
 * To understand the basic principle of splitting Multi-Operator With-Loops,
 * let us consider Multi-Operator With-Loops that contain standard operators
 * only, i.e., they do NOT contain propagates.
 * In these cases, we can split the operators into individual ones by simply
 * copying the entire With-Lopp body and by splitting the body-returns and
 * left hand sides accordingly. An assignment of the form
 *
 * a, b, c = with {
 *             ( [0] <= iv <= [5]) : ( 1, 2, 3);
 *           } ( genarray( [10]), modarray( x), fold( +, 0));
 *
 * is semantically equivalent to
 *
 * a = with {
 *       ( [0] <= iv <= [5]) : 1;
 *     } genarray( [10]);
 * b = with {
 *       ( [0] <= iv <= [5]) : 2;
 *     } modarray( x);
 * c = with {
 *       ( [0] <= iv <= [5]) : 3;
 *     } fold( +, 0);
 *
 * However, we have to be a bit careful here. By splitting the assignment into
 * several subsequent ones we might introduce parasitic bindings. Consider
 * a slight variation of the example above: rather than having an operator
 * "modarray( x)" we could have had an operator "modarray( a)". That "a" would
 * have referred to an array "a" defined earlier. If we now split naively as
 * outlined above, "a" would refer to the array generated by the first
 * With-Loop :-(
 * As a consequence, we need to introduce fresh variable names for the
 * split-off With-Loops and do a variable renaming afterwards.
 * Thus, we obtain:
 *
 * tmp_a = with {
 *           ( [0] <= iv <= [5]) : 1;
 *         } genarray( [10]);
 * tmp_b = with {
 *           ( [0] <= iv <= [5]) : 2;
 *         } modarray( x);
 * tmp_c = with {
 *           ( [0] <= iv <= [5]) : 3;
 *         } fold( +, 0);
 * a = tmp_a;
 * b = tmp_b;
 * c = tmp_c;
 *
 * So far, we have considered standard operators only. As soon as we introduce
 * propagate operators, the situation becomes more difficult.
 * As propagate operators can adapt to any range, in principle, we do not have
 * to split-off these at all. However, if we have to split a Multi-Operator
 * With-Loop that contains more than one standard operator, the question arises
 * where we put the propagate opertors. Essentially, three different approaches
 * may seem to be feasible at first sight here:
 *
 * APPROACH 1:
 *
 * we simply forbid Multi-Operator With-Loops that contain more than one
 * standard operator AND propagate operators.
 *
 * The drawbacks of this approach are:
 * - it seems to be a rather artificial restriction that is solely imposed
 *   by implementation limitations (which in fact is true;-).
 * - the illegal situation might be less obvious than one would assume as
 *   not all propagates are explicit in SaC. Using print within the
 *   With-Loop body suffices to make the compiler reject a program:-(
 *
 * APPROACH 2:
 *
 * we try to split-off all propagates as well.
 *
 * The drawback of this approach is:
 * - we may not be able to do that at all. Consider the following With-Loop:
 *
 *   a, file = with {
 *               ( [0] <= iv <= [5]) {
 *                 x, file = foo( iv, file);
 *               } : ( x, file);
 *             } ( genarray( shp), propagate( file));
 *
 *   Splitting-up this With-Loop in exactly the same manor as indicated
 *   before, we would obtain:
 *
 *   tmp_a = with {
 *             ( [0] <= iv <= [5]) {
 *               x, file = foo( iv, file);
 *             } : x;
 *           }  genarray( shp);
 *   tmp_file = with {
 *                ( [0] <= iv <= [5]) {
 *                  x, file = foo( iv, file);
 *                } : file;
 *              } propagate( file);
 *   a = tmp_a;
 *   file = tmp_file;
 *
 *   Unfortunately, this leads to a uniqueness error, as the initial
 *   file is being used, i.e., conceptually consumed, within the body
 *   of the first With-Loop but not propagated. Hence, the transformation
 *   is illegal! Detecting these cases statically may be doable (?) but
 *   seems to be rather difficult to detect.
 *
 * APPROACH 3:
 *
 * we copy all propagates into all With-Loops that we split-off.
 * For our example above that would mean that it stays unmodifed.
 * Looking at a slightly more complex example that contains more than one
 * standard operator, we would split
 *
 * a, b, file = with {
 *                ( [0] <= iv <= [5]) {
 *                  x, file = foo( iv, file);
 *                  y, file = foo( iv, file);
 *                } : ( x, y, file);
 *              } (genarray([20]), genarray([30]), propagate( file));
 * into
 * tmp_a, file = with {
 *                 ( [0] <= iv <= [5]) {
 *                   x, file = foo( iv, file);
 *                   y, file = foo( iv, file);
 *                 } : ( x, file);
 *               } (genarray([20]), propagate( file));
 * tmp_b, file = with {
 *                  ( [0] <= iv <= [5]) {
 *                    x, file = foo( iv, file);
 *                    y, file = foo( iv, file);
 *                  } : ( y, file);
 *               } ( genarray([30]), propagate( file));
 * a = tmp_a;
 * b = tmp_b;
 *
 * The drawback of this approach is:
 * - we would need to define the semantics of Multi-Operator With-Loops
 *   slightly unintuitively: all side-effects contained in any of the
 *   parts are executed as often as we have standard operators in the
 *   operator part.
 *
 * As can be seen from these deliberations, none of the three approaches
 * is really satisfying. Approach 1 is the only one really sound but
 * leaves the language incomplete; approach 2 may turn legal into illegal
 * code; and approach 3 requires the semantics to be defined in a rather
 * non-intuitive way.
 * However, since the ability to insert print statements ANYWHERE is
 * really helpfull for debugging, AND, since approach 3 comes almost for
 * free once we have implemented the splitting of standard operators anyways,
 * this module follows that approach.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * In the long run, though, I think we will have to extnd the backend to be
 * able to cope with Multi-Operator With-Loops that may have different
 * overall ranges. That would make this entire traversal redundant and still
 * keep the intuitive semantics intact!
 *
 *
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION:
 *
 * Note here, that we are very early in the phases. We have neither SSA,
 * nor is the code flattened yet! This implies that we have to be able
 * to deal with even more possible nestings!
 *
 * The transformation is guided by HWLOwith. It identifies the MOWLs
 * that require transformation with the help of    IsLegitimateMoWl.
 * Once a to-be-modified MOWL is found, the WITHOPs are being traversed.
 *
 * During that traversal, we identify whether we need to split off at least
 * one WL that has 1 standard operator and potentially copied propagates
 * (see discussion about alternatives above).
 * If so, the rlevant LHS, CEXPR, and WITHOPS are being collected and taken
 * out of the existing chains.
 *
 * Renamings are performed when we split off and the corresponding renaming
 * assignments are being put into INFO_HWLO_RENASSIGNS for later insertion.
 * Both these renaming related operations happen in the function 
 * RenameLHSandCreateRanamingAssign.
 * 
 * Upon return to HWLOwith, the split-off WL is generated and put into
 * INFO_HWLO_NEWASSIGNS for later insertion. 
 *
 * HWLOwith subsequently is applied recursively to the remaining WL again
 * to make sure all split-offs that are needed are actually being performed.
