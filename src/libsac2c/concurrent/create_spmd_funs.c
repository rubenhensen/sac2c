 * description:
 *
 *   We traverse each ST function body and look for with-loops to be
 *   parallelised. Each such with-loop is then lifted into a separate
 *   function definition and the with-loop itself is replaced by a 
 *   call of that function. The newly created fundefs are named and tagged
 *   SPMD functions. These functions will later implement switching from
 *   single-threaded execution to multithreaded execution and vice versa.
 *
 *   The necessary information to create a fully-fledged function definition,
 *   e.g. parameter names and types, return values and types, local variables
 *   and their types, is gathered during a full traversal of each with-loop
 *   tagged for multithreaded execution.
 *
 *   The PARAMETERS/ARGS of the spmd functions are inferred by looking for
 *   RELATIVELY FREE VARIABLES within the with-loop. This includes not only
 *   RFVs in the code but also within the generators and operators of the
 *   with-loop making sure that we capture things such as bounds, neutral
 *   elements, or the memory for the result of genarray with loops.
 *
 *   Although index variables (vectors, scalars, and IDXs) are RFVs as well
 *   they require special treatment. They need to be thread local and are
 *   treated as such (see below). Furthermore, their handling needs to be
 *   shifted from the calling context into the lifted function. Code
 *   for handling their memory will be generated in the spmd functions
 *   through a later traversal MTRMI (restore memory instructions).
 *   The redundant declarations of these in the calling context are being
 *   taken care of in yet another traversal named MTDCR (dead code removal).
 *
 *   The RETURN VALUES and types of the spmd functions are taken from
 *   the left hand side of the with-loops.
 * 
 *   For all LOCAL VARIABLES needed in the new spmd functions we collect
 *   those variables that are being locally defined within the with loop
 *   body. We add to these the left hand side variables of the with-loop
 *   and, for fold with loops, we provide freshly named temporary variables
 *   for each return value. These are needed for the fold operation within
 *   the synchronisation barrier.
 *
 *   Finally, the newly generated functions are inserted at the end of the
 *   fundef chain.
 *
 *
 *   For example, we transform 
 *
 *      a = with {
 *            ( lb <= iv < ub) {
 *               res = max( b[iv]);
 *            } : res;
 *          } : genarray( [100], 0);
 * 
 *   into
 *
 *      a = spmdfun( lb, ub, b);
 *
 *   and a new function
 *
 *      int[100] spmdfun( int[1] lb, int[1] ub, int[100,30] b)
 *      {
 *         int[100] a;
 *         int res;
 *         int[1] iv;
 *    
 *         a = with {
 *               ( lb <= iv < ub) {
 *                  res = max( b[iv]);
 *               } : res;
 *             } : genarray( [100], 0);
 *         return a;
 *      }
 *
 *   Note, that in the implementation we always deal with N_with2 here and
 *   that this also ensures that the variable holding the memory for the
 *   result is identified as relatively free variable :-)
 *
 *   Finally, this phase makes one more change. It deals with a subtle issue
 *   that occurs in the context of fold-WLs with non-scalar neutral elements:
 *
 *   To understand the issue, we need to understand how this phase relates to
 *   the memory management in SaC.
 *   The memory handling is done in the mem-phase which precedes the mt phase.
 *   The idea is that the choice as to whether we execute a WL sequentially or
 *   in parallel does not majorly effect the memory handling.
 *   Relatively free variables are kept alive until after the WL is completed
 *   in both scenarios (seq and mt); so there is no need to adjust that when
 *   switching from seq to mt.
 *   By lifting the local variables from the calling context into the spmd
 *   function we implicitly replicate all those across the threads.
 *   For most of these variables, this does not change anything as WL local
 *   variables typically cannot evade the scope of the WL and, therefore, a
 *   replication of the entire WL body is exactly what is needed.
 *
 *   However, there is one potential way for such a replicated local variable
 *   to evade the scope of the WL and that is through a fold-WL. In such a
 *   scenario, it is still not possible for all replicas to evade but, due
 *   to the folding operation, exactly one non-deterministically chosen replica
 *   can evade. Given this, it may seem that the memory assumptions for fold WLs
 *   can be carried over unchanged from seq to mt as well.
 *
 *   Unfortunately, this is not quite the case. In order to maximise reuse, the
 *   memory management of Fold-WLs allows the neutral elements to be reused
 *   for the accumulator whenever the fold operations permits this.
 *   While this is certainly desirable in case of a sequential execution
 *   (here it even would allow for suballoc within nested WLs), it breaks
 *   in the context of mt executions. Here, the neutral element is classified
 *   as relatively free variable, and it is assumed to survive the WL. (This
 *   is inevitable since we could reuse the neutral element for one thread
 *   at most anyways)
 *   While our noRC-in-parallel-WL-bodies regime enables survival of the neutral
 *   element, the non-mt aware mem phase assumes that the neutral element is
 *   always consumed *within* the WL, either by reuse or by discarding.
 *   Consequently, we cannot simply lift fold with-loops without adjusting
 *   the memory management of the neutral element. If we did, we would 
 *   generate a space leak on the neutral elements of parallel fold with
 *   loops. We resolve this problem by injecting a _dec_rc_(neutral, 1)
 *   directly after the call to the spmd function.
 *   This is done in this phase as well.
 *
 *   So, for example we transform
 *
 *      neutr = [0,0,0];
 *      a = with {
 *            ( lb <= iv < ub) {
 *               res = foo( b[iv]);
 *            } : res;
 *          } : fold( +, neutr);
 *
 *   into
 *
 *      neutr = [0,0,0];
 *      a = spmdfun (lb, ub, b);
 *      _dec_rc_ (neutr, 1)        <<<< MT-only parallel fold mem adjustment
 *
 *   and a new function
 *
 *      int[3] spmdfun( int[1] lb, int[1] ub, int[100,3] b, int[3] neutr)
 *      {
 *         int[3] fresh_tmp_a;
 *         int[3] a;
 *         int[3] res;
 *         int[1] iv;
 *
 *         a = with {
 *               ( lb <= iv < ub) {
 *                  res = foo( b[iv]);
 *               } : res;
 *             } : fold( +, neutr);
 *         return a;
 *      }
 *
 *
 * implementation:
 *   Most of the analysis is happening in MTSPMDFid and in MTSPMDFids. Here,
 *   the RFVs and local vars are being identified, and the corresponding parts
 *   of the new code are being created. 
 *   RFVs are being transformed into parameters (collected in INFO_PARAMS) and
 *   argument expressions (collected in INFO_ARGS). Local variables are 
 *   transformed into variable declarations (collected in INFO_VARDECS).
 *   Key to this process is the use of a LUT. Here we keep pointers to 
 *   N_avis nodes that we have encountered already. For each such entry
 *   we create a duplicate of the N_avis and hold that in the LUT as well.
 *   Later, when doing the actual function creation, we exchange all 
 *   old N_avis nodes by the new ones using that very LUT.
 *   This also allows us to avoid unnecessary duplicates when encountering
 *   the same variable more than once and it allows us to disambiguate
 *   RFVs from uses of local variables.
 *   The actual checking and code generation for the two cases
 *   (RFVs and local vars) are being done in local helper functions
 *      void HandleLocal( node *avis, info *arg_info)     and
 *      void HandleUse( node *avis, info *arg_info)
 *
 *   We use a flag INFO_COLLECT to indicate when we are traversing a 
 *   with loop that we want to lift out. It is being set before traversing
 *   the body of a to be parallelised with-loops and is reset once the 
 *   N_assign of that with-loop is being reached on the way back up.
 *   The actual function creation is done by a helper function
 *      node * CreateSpmdFundef (node *arg_node, info *arg_info)
 *   which is initiated on the N_let level.
 *
 *   To facilitate the fold with loop memory adjustment, we generate that
 *   code when traversing N_fold and put it into INFO_NEUTRALS.
 *   This code is eventually inserted after the spmd function call in 
 *   MTSPMDFassign.
