 *
 * description:
 *   This file contains the runtime components of the smart decision tool
 *   library. The compile time components of this library are located in
 *   compile.c. The smart decision tool tries to find the "optimal" amount of
 *   threads to solve a parallel task. The tool is used to optimize both
 *   the performance and energy consumption of parallel with loops. The smart
 *   decisions consist of two phases: the training phase and the decision
 *   phase. Each phase requires a recompilation of the sac file, using a
 *   special compilation mode. To compile for the training phase one has to
 *   set the compiler option -mt_smart_mode to 'train'. To compile for the
 *   decision phase the -mt_smart_mode option should be set to 'on'. The
 *   default for the -mt_smart_mode option is 'off', meaning that the smart
 *   decision tool is not being used. The training phase binary has to be
 *   executed before the decision binary is executed. During the training phase
 *   data is collected to create a performance profile of the current machine.
 *   The training phase can be done multiple times in order to collect more
 *   data to construct a more accurate performance profile. The profile is
 *   stored in a separate database (.db) file. After training the decision
 *   binary can be executed, during this phase smart decisions are used to
 *   optimize for the number of threads that are used for each parallel with
 *   loop. The decision phase uses the database file in order to predict the
 *   most optimal settings. If the program has to be executed on several
 *   machines, one has to make sure that a profile is created for each of
 *   these machines.
 *
 * important files:
 *   - mt_smart.h: contains the function primitives of this file
 *   - compile.c: contains the compile time components of this library
 *     (initialization of compile time components of smart tool: COMPdoPrepareSmart
 *function executing compile time components of smart tool: COMPdoDecideSmart function
 *		finalization of compile time components of smart tool: COMPdoFinalizeSmart
 *function there are also a few helper functions in compile.c, such as: rank,
 *create_smart_decision_data, and destroy_smart_decision_data)
