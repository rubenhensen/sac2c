/*
 * This test is ported from testsuite/scanparse/nonscalarcell.sac
 *
 * Non-scalar cell created by producerWL.
 *
 * No bug was filed for this, but it appeared around
 * the same time as Bug #959.
 *
 * Symptoms are that, at -b1, the WL only has a single partition!
 * We stop after -b3 because filterop, by default, looks for
 *   _MAIN::main
 * and that does not exist until -b3.
