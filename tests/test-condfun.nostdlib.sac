/*
 *
 * Try to find crc.sac bug that puts -ecc code above if() in
 * condfun.
 *
 * See Bug #1079 to see why this does not work properly.
 *
 * This test requires that we run with -dolacsi to ensure
 * that the guards on the two sel() ops are removed.
 * It also requires -ecc or -doawlf.
 *
 * PWLF note:
 * As of sac2c Build #18548 (or earlier), without -doawlf 
 * (for our purposes, -doivext would suffice, were it an option)
 * one guard is not removed, because we need extrema information
 * about N within the N_cond. If we want to eliminate the need
 * to drag extrema around with us, we might want to make
 * PHUT treat LACFUNs better. I.e., make it do interprocedural 
 * analysis. This might also supplant the need for -dolacsi/-dolacso.
 *
 * The above PHUT extension should work.
