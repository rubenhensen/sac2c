## testsuite/aud_wl
    EMPY.

## testsuite/constraints
    Do we want simply run those tests?


## testsuite/flatten
    DONE.

## testsuite/mt
    Is the criterion for these tests is just the fact that they run?

## testsuite/mutc
    Not sure how to test it.  We don't have mutc-related tools.

## testsuite/nested
    Nested arrays.  As far as I understand they are not fully supported.
    What shall we expect from the tests?

## testsuite/object
    Requires Stdlib, not sure what to expect from these tests.


## testsuite/optimizations
    Work in progress.  A lot of tests!


## testsuite/partial_ap
    As far as I understand, this is unfinished project from Jara to
    support hiher-order reductions.  Not sure what are the expectations.

## testsuite/scanparse
    DONE.

## testsuite/simd
    I don't understand what is the criterion for the test to pass.  Just compile and run?

## testsuite/stdlib
    I don't understand what is the criterion for the test to pass.  Just compile and run?

## testsuite/unibench
    This requires non-trivial standard library, and it seem to test very
    specific unibench functionality.  I don't really think that this is
    useful anymore.
